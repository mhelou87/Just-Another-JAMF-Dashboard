<br>

A Google Sheets template for a JAMF dashboard - a tool to help your IT/MDM/CPE teams manage their environment and share high-level views with stakeholders.

While this was designed with the JAMF product in mind, it could be adapted for other platforms as well. This is meant to be a starting point, feel free to make further customizations as needed.

    <br> _**Disclaimer**_: _The transfer to Excel has not been tested and so no guarantee's are made as to the preservation of custom formatting. Additionally, the formula in use must be updated from Google's "importrange" to Excel's equivalent "workbook links"; Find out more from the official article from [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-workbook-links-c98d1803-dd75-4668-ac6a-d7cca2a9b95f)._

### Tab Guide:
**Dashboard** <br> This pulls data from the other tabs, providing the high-level view of the JSS. Users will need to update the 4 formulas on this tab. 

**PreStage Enrollment** <br> Keep notes on what's being configured or enforced by payload.

**Policies** <br> List out Policies and see some configuration details, like if they are using scripts or PKGs & the availability via Policy or Self Service. Additional columns help indicate the use of JAMF Composer for custom PKG builds and availability to PreStage Enrollments.

**Configuration Profiles** <br> List out what is being pushed, indicating simple scoping by PreStage Enrollment. 

**Extension Attributes** <br> List out the state of ExtAttr's.

**Maintenance** <br> This pulls some data from other tabs and provides a 12 month calendar to help you schedule out any required maintenance needs. Whether that's auditing the assets in a PreStage Enrollment, updating a PKG from a vendor, or updating Smart Group parameters, this can help you find an optimal scheduling cadence. Utilize Google Sheet's "Smart Chips" to provide a link to the calendar event for reference. Users will need to update the 2 formulas on this tab.
